## Overall description
This web application is intended for my students studying test automation. The application only contains `index.html` and multiple endpoints, which can be used to manipulate data in Postgresql.

# /generate-token

This endpoint is used to generate token

* To get the token, send POST request to `/generate-token` endpoint.

Request example:
```
{
    "username": "<your username>",
    "password": "<your password>"
}
```

Response example:
```
{
    "token": "<generated token>"
}
```
`Note:`
Generated token should be included as a 'Bearer' token in the Authorization header of all requests to authenticate access

# /employees

This endpoint is used to manipulate data in `employees` table

* To fetch all employees in your DB, send GET request to `/employees` endpoint.

Response example:
```
[
    {
        "employeeId": 1,
        "name": "Steven",
        "organization": "IT",
        "role": "Developer"
    },
    {
        "employeeId": 2,
        "name": "Mark",
        "organization": "IT",
        "role": "PM"
    }
]
```
* To fetch single employee in your DB, send GET request to `/employees/<employee_id>` endpoint.

Response example:
```
{
    "employeeId": 2,
    "name": "Mark",
    "organization": "IT",
    "role": "PM"
}
```

    "role": "QA"
}
```
